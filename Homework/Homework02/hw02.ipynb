    "If you expected Old Faithful to erupt every hour, you would expect to wait a total of `60 * k` minutes to see `k` eruptions. Use the `np.arange` function to create a range of values where each element represents the total expected time (in minutes) one would spend waiting for  waiting for `k` erruptions to occur under the assumption erumptions occur once an hour. Set `expected_wait` to this range of values. You can read about `np.arange` as needed in this [textbook section](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/05/2/Ranges.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, set `difference_from_expected` to an array with 272 elements, where the element at index `i` is the absolute difference between the actual and expected total amount of waiting time to see the first `i+1` eruptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1**: You'll need to compare a cumulative sum to a range. \n",
